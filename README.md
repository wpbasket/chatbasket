## 📐 Engineering & Architecture

We have documented the complex engineering patterns used in this app in detailed READMEs located in their respective directories.

### Core Systems
1.  **[Root Architecture & Routing](./app/README_ROOT_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   *How `_layout.tsx` orchestrates initialization, Deep Links, and Route Guards.*
2.  **[Authentication System](./state/auth/README_AUTH.md)**
    *   *Session management, Token Encryption, and Hydration loop.*
3.  **[Deep Linking & Race Conditions](./state/appMode/README_DEEP_LINKING.md)**
    *   *How we solved the "Native Deep Link" race condition using synchronous Mode updates.*

### Infrastructure
4.  **[Notification System (Two-Token)](./notification/README_NOTIFICATIONS.md)**
    *   *Android FCM implementation, Share Intent conflicts, and Background Listeners.*
5.  **[Storage Strategy (Hybrid Encryption)](./lib/storage/README_STORAGE.md)**
    *   *Why we mix MMKV (Speed) with SecureStore (Key Management).*
6.  **[API Layer](./lib/README_API_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   *Typed Singleton patterns for decoupling UI from Network logic.*

### UI & State patterns
7.  **[Global Modal System](./components/modals/README_MODAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   *The "Imperative Promise" pattern for clean modal usage.*
8.  **[UI Design System](./components/ui/README_UI_SYSTEM.md)**
    *   *Semantic Theming using `react-native-unistyles`.*
9.  **[State Management patterns](./state/README_STATE_PATTERNS.md)**
    *   *Legend-State "Observable Store" philosophy.*

## 🔄 App Lifecycle Overview

For new developers, here is how the app boots up:

1.  **Splash Screen**: The app launches and holds the Splash Screen (in `_layout.tsx`).
2.  **Auth Hydration**:
    *   Reads Encrypted Session Tokens from MMKV.
    *   If valid, sets `authState.isLoggedIn = true`.
3.  **Deep Link Check (Critical)**:
    *   Checks `Linking.getInitialURL()`.
    *   If a link exists (e.g., `chatbasket://public/profile`), it sets `appMode = 'public'` **synchronously**.
4.  **Route Guard Evaluation**:
    *   `Stack.Protected` runs.
    *   If `isLoggedIn` is false -> Redirect to `/login`.
    *   If `appMode` matches the Route -> Render Screen.
5.  **Render**: The Splash Screen fades, and the user interacts with the app.
